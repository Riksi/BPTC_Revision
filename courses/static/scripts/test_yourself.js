Can tie this function to every module and topic but with 

Need to create a function that takes as arguments:
>Module
>Topic
>Number of questions
>Weakest areas

The function should then get hold of a random selection of 
questions based on this 

It should get hold of a random number of questions and output them in accordance with the choices
