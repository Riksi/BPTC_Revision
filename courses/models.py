Remember to use the set_password() for setting password after creating
the user

The primary attributes of the default user are:

username
password
email
first_name
last_name


username
	Required. 30 characters or fewer. Usernames may contain alphanumeric, _, @, +, . and - characters.

email
	Optional. Email address.

date_joined
	A datetime designating when the account was created. Is set to the current date/time by default when the account is created.
